# AskMySheet

## What is AskMySheet?

AskMySheet lets you chat with your Excel files. Just upload your spreadsheet and ask questions in plain English, no formulas needed!

"What were my top 5 expenses last month?"  

"Show me sales trends by region for Q2" 

"Which products had increasing sales but decreasing profits?"
