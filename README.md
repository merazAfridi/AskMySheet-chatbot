## What is AskMySheet?

AskMySheet lets you chat with your Excel files. Just upload your spreadsheet and ask questions in plain English - no formulas needed!

"What were my top 5 expenses last month?" ✓  
"Show me sales trends by region for Q2" ✓  
"Which products had increasing sales but decreasing profits?" ✓
